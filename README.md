This repository contains the lab assignments for the **Artificial Intelligence Techniques (AIT)** course, part of the Third Year (TY) curriculum, under the guidance of **Ms. Snehal Mangale**.

The labs focus on the practical implementation of core AI algorithms from scratch. Topics range from state-space search and heuristic-based pathfinding to constraint satisfaction and adversarial search for game playing. All assignments are implemented in Python within Jupyter Notebooks.

## ðŸ“š Lab Assignments

This repository is organized by lab, with each Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file corresponding to a specific assignment.

| Lab No. | Topic                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lab 1** | **State-Space Search** | A solution to the classic **Water Jug Problem** using a rule-based simulation to find a path from an initial state to a goal state.                                               |
| **Lab 2** | **Uninformed Search Algorithms** | Implementation of Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path in the **8-Puzzle Problem** and to navigate a **Maze**.                                     |
| **Lab 3** | **Informed (Heuristic) Search** | Solving pathfinding problems using the **A\* Search algorithm**. This lab compares the performance of **Manhattan** and **Euclidean** distance heuristics.                 |
| **Lab 4** | **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)** | Solving logic puzzles like the **N-Queens Problem**, **Sudoku**, and the **Map Coloring Problem** using backtracking combined with the **Forward Checking** technique.     |
| **Lab 5** | **Adversarial Search (Game Theory)** | Building an unbeatable AI for **Tic-Tac-Toe** by implementing the **Minimax algorithm**. The AI explores the game tree to find the optimal move at each step.            |
